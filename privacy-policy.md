## The Kraken Project Privacy Policy 11/11/20

This document describes how The Kraken Project (“we” or “us”) collects and uses information about you when you use our mobile apps Agora and Kraken ("the Services"). This Privacy Policy only applies to our practices associated with these mobile apps.

### General Practices

We collect information you provide to us directly when you use the Services. This includes:

Profile Information. We may require you to provide a username and password in order to use the Services. Your username is public and does not need to be related to your real name. You may also provide other account information such as a bio or profile picture. Your profile may contain information such as which teams, proposals, or votes you have participated in. We may store your user account preferences and settings.

Profile Verification. We may require you to submit information such as your name, phone number, photo, street address, or other identification in order to access certain restricted features of the Services that are reserved for verified accounts.

Content You Submit. We collect any content you submit to the Services. This includes comments, proposals, amendments, delegates, votes, teams, and actions. Your content may include text, links, images, and videos. Other members of the Services may be able to see this content as well the username, date, and time associated with the content.

Communication with Other Members. We allow you to share content on the Services which is visible to other members. Some of this content will only be visible within Groups (a subset of members) and some will be visible publicly (to all members). We may allow other members to block your communications.

Privacy. We may restrict who can access certain groups by providing adminstrative controls to certain users. We may also restrict access by requiring profile verification before joining or participating in certain groups. However, though content may be restricted when you post it, it may become public or available to new members and you should consider this possibility before posting to the Services. Member-submitted content is not visible on public search engines such as Google.

Trust. Sharing communications outside of the intended Group is considered a breach of trust. Harassment is also considered a breach of trust. You may not gather information from the Services, either manually or on an automated basis, to share with parties outside of the Services. Violating this provision may lead to a loss of account privileges.

Data Retention. We will honor any legal obligations or user requests to delete data. Absent any obligations, we may choose to retain information in our server logs, databases, or other records indefinitely.

Security. The Services use https to reduce the risk of unauthorized interception of any content being transmitted. Content may be stored without encryption on your device. We cannot guarantee that your information will not be improperly accessed in general.

Deleting Your Profile. You may delete your profile at any time from the settings page. After you delete your profile, your username and profile page are no longer visible to other users. Content you submit prior to deleting your account will still be visible to others unless you first delete individual content.

Third Parties. We do not share your information with any third parties.

### Changes to This Policy

We encourage you to review the Privacy Policy whenever you interact with our Services in order to stay informed and help protect your privacy. By continuing to use our Services after Privacy Policy changes go into effect, you agree to be bound by the revised policy.
