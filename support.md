When launching the app for the first time, you will be asked to create an account. Choose a username and password. If the username is already in use, you will receive an error and need to choose a different username.

You can create proposals for people to discuss and vote on. For now, proposals are public and accessible to everyone.

You can vote on all proposals. You can vote yes, no, or abstain. Votes are public.

You can comment on and propose amendments to all proposals.

You can create or request to join teams with other members. Once you have joined a team you can create actions for that team.
